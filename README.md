# Basic Haskell Examples
Copyright &copy; 2015 Bart Massey

The Haskell examples here are intended for beginners. The
problems are mostly from Gabriel Gonzalez
<http://www.haskellforall.com/2015/10/basic-haskell-examples.html>;
the solutions are mostly by me.

* `todo.hs`: TODO List (problem: Gonzalez (#1), solution: Massey)

  Interactively process a list of commands to maintain an
  in-memory TODO list. Tough one to start with when teaching
  Haskell.

* `tabcomma.hs`: Tab-Separated Values -> CSV (problem:
  Gonzalez (#2), solution: Massey)

  Effectively, replace all tabs with commas while
  translating standard input to standard output.

* `tabcomma2.hs`: Tab-Separated Values -> CSV (problem:
  Gonzalez (#2), solution: Massey)

  Do full TSV->CSV with quoting and escaping.  Requires the
  `ssv` package from Hackage.

* `calendar2015.hs`: Print a 2015 calendar (problem:
  Gonzalez (#3), solution: Massey)

  Print an ASCII 2015 calendar.
